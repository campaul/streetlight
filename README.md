# Streetlight

Streetlight is a collection of utilities for reading and writing HTTP data.

## Examples

### File Server
Source: `examples/file_server.rs`

Usage: `cargo run --example file_server`

Serves files from the current directory on port 8080. This repository includes an `index.html` file so you just need to visit `localhost:8080` after starting this example to see a page.
